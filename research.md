My research uses computational methods to trace the evolution of cultural ideas about identity. I also use field experiments to examine how complex and intersecting identity signals shape access to resources.

#### 📖 Narratives and Cultural Ideas
In my dissertation, I use computational methods to trace the emergence and **evolution of cultural ideas about the self, identity, and agency**. Drawing on an original, large-scale dataset of digitized autobiographies, I map the historical development of now-ubiquitous ideas about the self---like the importance of being "hardworking" or "emotionally expressive." My research pinpoints the origins of gendered fractures in cultural conceptions of the self.

#### 📊 Causal Modeling and Language Use
I'm also interested in modeling the causes of discursive change and the effects of framing choices.  With [Dennis Yi Tenen](https://dennistenen.com/) and [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](https://moacir.com/), I'm modeling the impact of a 1990s GOP initiative that **encouraged Republicans to use emotionally charged terms** on long-term trends in political speech. With [Siwei Cheng](https://siwei-cheng.github.io/), I'm investigating how the **topical focus and framing of sociological conference papers** shape their likelihood of eventual publication.

#### 🧑‍🦽 Intersectional Identities and Discrimination
I use experiments to investigate how individuals respond to multifaceted presentations of identity. With Nnamdi Jogwe, I fielded a **large-scale audit study on racialized disability discrimination**, sending matched actors to visit 1,600 businesses in NYC to request to urgently access the restroom due to their disability. With [Gunn Birkelund](https://www.sv.uio.no/iss/english/people/aca/gunnb/) and [Edvard Nergård Larsen](https://www.samfunnsforskning.no/english/people/res/edvardnl/), I've published a [meta-analysis on gender-based hiring discrimination](https://www.scup.com/doi/full/10.18261/issn.1504-7989-2021-03-04-03) in male- and female-dominated occupations [in Norwegian; English translation available upon request].

Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I studied cross-national wealth inequality trends with economists [William Darity, Jr.](https://sanford.duke.edu/profile/william-darity/) and [Omer Ali](https://www.econ.pitt.edu/people/omer-ali) and anthropologist [Marta Sánchez](https://people.uncw.edu/sanchezm/). Our short article is published in [_AEA Papers & Proceedings_](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211114), and our extended working paper is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WiS8UY9gyljMAsCYgRwJMZGVYdeyaoz2/view).
