My research uses computational methods to trace the evolution of cultural ideas about identity and the self. I also use field experiments to examine how intersecting identity signals shape access to resources.

In my dissertation, I use computational methods to trace the emergence and **evolution of cultural ideas about the self, identity, and agency** in the United States and the United Kingdom. Drawing on an original, large-scale dataset of digitized autobiographies, I map the historical development of now-ubiquitous ideas about the self, like the importance of being "hardworking" or "emotionally expressive." My research pinpoints the origins of gendered fractures in cultural conceptions of the self.

I'm also interested in modeling the causes of discursive change and the social effects of language and framing choices.  With [Dennis Yi Tenen](https://dennistenen.com/) and [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](https://moacir.com/), I'm modeling the impact of a 1990s GOP initiative that **encouraged Republicans to use emotionally charged language** on long-term trends in political speech. With [Siwei Cheng](https://siwei-cheng.github.io/), I'm investigating how the **topical focus and framing of sociological conference papers** shape their likelihood of eventual publication.

I use experiments to investigate how individuals respond to multifaceted presentations of identity. With graduate student co-author [Nnamdi Jogwe](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology/people/current-phd-students/nnamdi-jogwe.html), I fielded a **large-scale audit study on racialized disability discrimination**, sending matched actors to visit 1,600 businesses in NYC to request to urgently access the restroom due to their disability. With [Gunn Birkelund](https://www.sv.uio.no/iss/english/people/aca/gunnb/) and [Edvard Nergård Larsen](https://www.samfunnsforskning.no/english/people/res/edvardnl/), I've published a [meta-analysis on gender-based hiring discrimination](https://www.scup.com/doi/full/10.18261/issn.1504-7989-2021-03-04-03) in male- and female-dominated occupations [in Norwegian; English translation available upon request].

Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I studied cross-national wealth inequality trends with economists [William Darity, Jr.](https://sanford.duke.edu/profile/william-darity/) and [Omer Ali](https://www.econ.pitt.edu/people/omer-ali) and anthropologist [Marta Sánchez](https://people.uncw.edu/sanchezm/). Our short article is published in [_AEA Papers & Proceedings_](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211114), and our extended working paper is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zas0R5EHyfYW_wpI-_P4kz8k8Hnz56Ow/view?usp=sharing).
