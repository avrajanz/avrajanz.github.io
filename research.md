### Research 
My research uses computational methods to trace the evolution of cultural ideas about identity. I also use field experiments to examine how complex and intersecting identity signals shape access to resources.

#### üìñ Narratives and Cultural Ideas
In my dissertation, I use computational methods to trace the emergence and **evolution of cultural ideas about the self, identity, and agency**. Drawing on an original, large-scale dataset of digitized autobiographies, I map the historical development of now-ubiquitous ideas about the self--like the importance of being "hardworking" or "emotionally expressive." My research pinpoints the origins of gendered fractures in cultural conceptions of the self.

#### üìä Causal Modeling and Language Use
I also model the causes and effects of language and framing choices.  With [Dennis Yi Tenen](https://dennistenen.com/) and [Moacir P. de S√° Pereira](https://moacir.com/), I'm modeling the impact of a 1990s GOP initiative that **encouraged Republicans to use emotionally charged terms** on long-term speech trends in Congress. With [Siwei Cheng](https://siwei-cheng.github.io/), I'm investigating how the **topical focus and framing of sociological conference papers** shape their probability of publication.

#### üßë‚Äçü¶Ω Intersectional Identities and Discrimination
I use experiments to investigate how individuals respond to multifaceted presentations of identity. With Nnamdi Jogwe, I fielded a **large-scale audit study on racialized disability discrimination**, sending matched actors to visit 1,600 businesses in NYC to request to urgently access the restroom due to their disability. With [Gunn Birkelund](https://www.sv.uio.no/iss/english/people/aca/gunnb/) and [Edvard Nerg√•rd Larsen](https://www.samfunnsforskning.no/english/people/res/edvardnl/), I've published a meta-analysis on gender-based hiring discrimination in male- and female-dominated occupations.

Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I studied cross-national wealth inequality trends with economists [William Darity, Jr.](https://sanford.duke.edu/profile/william-darity/) and [Omer Ali](https://www.econ.pitt.edu/people/omer-ali). Our short article is published in [_AEA Papers & Proceedings_](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211114), and our extended working paper is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WiS8UY9gyljMAsCYgRwJMZGVYdeyaoz2/view).
