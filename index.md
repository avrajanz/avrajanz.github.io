Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Sociology at [New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology/people/current-phd-students/janz--avra.html). My research uses computational methods to investigate questions related to culture, identity, and the self. 

I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a degree in Economics in 2021. My research has been published in the [_AEA Papers & Proceedings_](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211114) and the [_Norwegian Journal of Working Life Studies_](https://www.scup.com/doi/full/10.18261/issn.1504-7989-2021-03-04-03).
