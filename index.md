Hi! I'm a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) in Sociology at [New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology/people/current-phd-students/janz--avra.html). I use computational and experimental methods to investigate questions related to culture, identity, and the self. My research has been published in the [_AEA Papers & Proceedings_](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211114) and the [_Norwegian Journal of Working Life Studies_](https://www.scup.com/doi/full/10.18261/issn.1504-7989-2021-03-04-03). 

I am currently affiliated with the [New York University Identities and Ideologies Project](https://www.identities-ideologies.org/) and the [Columbia University Narrative Intelligence Lab](https://nil.columbia.edu/). Previously, I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with Highest Honors in Economics.

In fall 2025, I will be in research residency at New York University--Paris.
