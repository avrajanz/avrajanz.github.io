Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in Sociology at [New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/sociology/people/current-phd-students/janz--avra.html). I use computational and experimental methods to investigate questions related to culture, identity, and the self. My research has been published in the [_AEA Papers & Proceedings_](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211114) and the [_Norwegian Journal of Working Life Studies_](https://www.scup.com/doi/full/10.18261/issn.1504-7989-2021-03-04-03). 

I am currently affiliated with the [New York University Identities and Ideologies Project](https://www.identities-ideologies.org/) and the [Columbia University Narrative Intelligence Lab](https://nil.columbia.edu/). Previously, I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with Highest Honors in Economics.

In fall 2025, I will be in research residency at New York University--Paris. 

### Research Interests

**Narratives and Cultural Change:** In my dissertation, I use computational methods to trace the emergence and evolution of cultural ideas about the self, identity, and agency. Drawing on an original, large-scale dataset of digitized autobiographies, I map the historical development of now-ubiquitous ideas about the self--like the importance of being "hardworking" or "emotionally expressive." My research pinpoints the origins of gendered fractures in cultural conceptions of the self.

**Causal Modeling and Language Use:** I'm also interested in modeling the causes and consequences of discursive trends.  With [Dennis Yi Tenen](https://dennistenen.com/) and [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](https://moacir.com/), I'm modeling the causal impact of a 1990s GOP initiative that encouraged Republicans to use specific, emotionally charged terms on long-term trends in political speech. With [Siwei Cheng](https://siwei-cheng.github.io/), I'm investigating how references to specific topics and demographic groups in sociological conference papers shape their probability of eventual publication.

**Intersectional Identities and Discrimination:** I use experiments to investigate how individuals and institutions respond to multifaceted presentations of identity. With graduate student co-author Nnamdi Jogwe, I fielded a large-scale audit study on racialized disability discrimination, sending matched actors to visit 1,600 businesses in NYC to request to urgently access the restroom due to their disability. With [Gunn Birkelund](https://www.sv.uio.no/iss/english/people/aca/gunnb/) and [Edvard Nergård Larsen](https://www.samfunnsforskning.no/english/people/res/edvardnl/), I've published a meta-analysis on gender-based hiring discrimination in male- and female-dominated occupations.

Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I studied cross-national wealth inequality trends with economists [William Darity, Jr.](https://sanford.duke.edu/profile/william-darity/) and [Omer Ali](https://www.econ.pitt.edu/people/omer-ali). Our short article is published in [_AEA Papers & Proceedings_](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211114), and our extended working paper is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WiS8UY9gyljMAsCYgRwJMZGVYdeyaoz2/view).
